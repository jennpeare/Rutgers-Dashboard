###Our Project
We made a dashboard web application intended for Rutgers students. It displays information useful for everyday happenings, such as Nextbus, dining hall menus, and the current weather. This web app is hosted on the hackerspace server and can also be displayed on a monitor through a Raspberry Pi.

## Method
###Key Software
- Arduino (previous attempt)
- Raspberry Pi
- Web server
- Various APIs (wunderground, nextbus)

###Final Design
Our initial idea was to display useful information on a scrolling LED screen powered by an Arduino. This was later changed to the Raspberry Pi and display monitor, since it would provide more space and capability to display more useful information. The information is a web application written mostly in Python and styled using the Foundation framework.

- Final design for your system

## Results
- Qualitative: Pictures, videos, descriptions
- Quantitative: if you have them and it makes sense

## Final thoughts
- Future work, extensions
- Pitfalls and snags
- Things you'd do differently next time
